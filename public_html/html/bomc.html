    		<span>Each month we will select an upcoming trade or hardback from the Previews Catalog.  After the book arrives, a book club will gather at Kowabunga to discuss what we have read.  This book will have a 15% discount applied to those who pre-order, and all are welcome to join us, whether you read the book or not.</span>
